# Description
CacheOut is a [[transient execution]] microarchitectural attack that is able to leak data from microarchitectural buffers (**Microarchitectural Data Sampling, MDS**) during transit. Additionally, it is capable of leaking arbitrary data from the L1-D cache and control what to leak from the victim address spaceâ€”which was a novelty upon its release
# Background
CacheOut is primarily concerned with the [[Line Fill Buffer]] (LFB), which is responsible for certain data transfers between the L1-D cache, the L2 cache, and the core. See the notes for LFBs for more details.

CacheOut is additionally reliant on Intel's Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX). Essentially, via the `xbegin` and `xend` TSX instructions, programs can denote sections of code as transactional and effectively execute these instructions atomically. However, this assumes a lack of concurrency conflicts across the transactional instructions. If there exists a conflict, the program is aborted, i.e. reverted to its initial state prior to the transaction, and then execution is continued. In other words, Intel TSX is another form of **transient execution**.

[[TSX Asynchronous Abort]] (TAA) is another transient execution attack that leaks data from the LFB. In short, it attempts to load data transactionally while an instruction flushing the memory address being accessed is in flight. This will cause a cache line conflict, inducing a transactional abort. However, the transient execution leaves a microarchitectural effect in the LFB, which can be leaked via cache attacks like [[Flush and Reload]] or [[Prime and Probe]]. This attack is extended in CacheOut in the form of [[#TAA-NG]] to allow reading entire cache lines, as TAA can only leak at most 8 bytes of every 64-byte cache line.
# Attack
## Attacking Victim Writes
In other words, leaking a victim's secret after they wrote to an address.

Here is the main idea:
```c
// victim:
// (1)
a = secret

// attacker:
// (2)
for (i = 0; i < 8; ++i) //evict secret from L1D cache
	*(evict_set + 4096 * i) = 0;

// (3)
TAA-NG(FRbuffer);

// (4)
for (i = 0; i < 256; ++i)
	if (flush_reload(FRbuffer + i * 4096))
		++results[i];
```
### Step 1: Victim Write
The victim writes the secret to the address `&a`. This is cached in the L1-D cache.
### Step 2: Eviction
First, the attacker finds the correct eviction set for the secret. The attacker then accesses this eviction set to evict the victim's secret from the L1-D cache. This actually transfers this data into the LFB, a previously [[#New Data Path|undocumented data path]].
### Step 3: TAA-NG
Then, using [[#TAA-NG]], the attacker leaks data from the LFB into the cache, i.e. the "send" step of this covert channel.
### Step 4: Flush and Reload
By using [[Flush and Reload]], the attacker receives the secret from the covert channel in the cache.
## Attacking Victim Reads
That is, leaking a victim's secret after they read the secret from an address.

Here is the main idea:
```c
// attacker:
// (1)
for (i = 0; i < 8; ++i) //evict secret from L1D cache
	*(evict_set + 4096 * i) = 0;

// victim:
// (2)
if (secret) { // this loads secret into the L1-D cache
	do_something();
}

// (3)
TAA-NG(FRbuffer);

// (4)
for (i = 0; i < 256; ++i)
	if (flush_reload(FRbuffer + i * 4096))
		++results[i];
```
### Step 1: Eviction
This is the same as in the write attack.
### Step 2: Victim Read
The victim uses the secret value in some way, effectively reading it and thus loading it into the L1-D cache.
### Step 3: TAA-NG
Same as write attack.
### Step 4: Flush and Reload
Same as write attack.
## TAA-NG
The relevant code is as follows:
```asm
 1 ; %rdi = leak source
 2 ; %rsi = FLUSH + RELOAD channel 
 3 ; %rcx = offset-control address 
 4 taa_ng_sample: 
 5 ; Cause TSX to abort asynchronously. 
 6 clflush (%rdi) 
 7 clflush (%rsi) 
 8 ; Leak a single byte. 
 9 xbegin abort 
 10 movq (%rdi), %rax 
 11 shl $12, %rax 
 12 andq $0xff000, %rax 
 13 movq (%rax, %rsi), %rax 
 14 movq (%rcx), %rax 
 15 movq (%rcx), %rax 
 16 xend 
 17 abort: 
 18 retq
```
### Original TAA
First, we simulate an eviction of the secret from the cache via line 6, flushing the address of the secret. (In a real attack scenario, the attacker would access an address in their address space to cause eviction).

Then, the next line flushes the array of the flush and reload covert channel. Immediately after, it begins the TSX transaction with `xbegin abort`. The TSX transaction will later attempt to read `*rsi` in line 13, while the `cflush` instruction is still in-flight; however, since it was flushed from the cache prior to the transaction, the transaction will abort, causing transitive execution.

From lines 10 to 13, the attacker performs a classic transitive execution attack to essentially "store" the secret in the microarchitectural state by loading an address in the flush and reload array dependent on the secret itself. See [[Meltdown]] for a more detailed explanation.
### TAA-NG
The novelties of TAA-NG are enabled entirely by lines 14 and 15. Attempting to set `rax` to a desired offset *after* the array access actually provides the attacker precise control over the byte offset into the victim cache line. This is the key idea that allows leaking from an arbitrary offset in the cache line.

There is (or at least was) no public Intel documentation about this occurrence. The authors hypothesized that the lack of data dependency allowed out-of-order execution, in which those instructions were executed *before* the instructions that precede them. Also, they hypothesized that the LFB has a read offset that makes this control over the leak possible.
## Key Results
### Control Over Desired Leakage
By using eviction sets, an attacker can precisely control the desired cache line to leak from the victim's address space.
### Full Cache Line Leakage
As aforementioned, [[#TAA-NG]] allows an attacker to leak qwords from arbitrary offsets in a cache line of the LFB, rather than just 8 bytes.
### Arbitrary L1-D Leakage
Data appears to remain present in the L1-D cache for millions of cycles. By evicting from the L1-D, rather than simply sampling from the LFB and hoping the target data is in-flight, an attacker can precisely target any victim data in the L1-D cache.
## Other Notes
### New Data Path
CacheOut appears to leverage a new, undocumented data path in Intel CPUs. Essentially, data evicted from the L1-D cache will actually find its way to the LFB before reaching the L2 cache.
# Impact
CacheOut can leak:
- arbitrary data in cross-thread, cross-process, and cross-VM attacks
- OpenSSL cryptographic keys
- neural network parameters
- KASLR and hypervisor ASLR
- arbitrary data from Intel SGX (even gained ability to sign fake attestation quotes)
# Mitigations
Intel TSX is no longer supported on newer Intel chips (mitigated in 2021, from *Skylake* beyond), which CacheOut relies on for its exploit.
