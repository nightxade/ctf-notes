# Description
Overwrite the [[GOT]] of a linked [[LIBC]] function $f$ with your own address of gadgets, other functions, etc. The technique requires [[RELRO#Full RELRO|Full RELRO]] to be **disabled**.
# Notes
- If [[ASLR]] is enabled, but you want to link a LIBC address to $f$, you can perform a [[partial overwrite]] of the LIBC address of $f$. This may require $4$ or $12$ bits of [[brute force]] if you need to overwrite $2$ or $3$ bytes of the least significant bytes, respectively.
- If you can write enough bytes into the GOT, you can write a [[ROP]] chain into it.
	- This can cause issues if any other LIBC functions linked in the GOT are called during program execution, and you overwrote that function's GOT entry with your ROP chain.
